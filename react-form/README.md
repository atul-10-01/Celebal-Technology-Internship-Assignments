# React Form Validation Project

**Celebal Technologies Internship Task**

This is a comprehensive React form application developed as part of the React development course during my internship at Celebal Technologies. The project demonstrates advanced form handling, validation, and routing capabilities without relying on third-party validation libraries.

## 🎯 Project Overview

A complete user registration form with comprehensive validation, error handling, and a success page to display submitted data. This project showcases modern React development practices and clean, maintainable code architecture.

## ✨ Features

### Form Fields
- **Personal Information**: First Name, Last Name, Username
- **Authentication**: Email, Password (with show/hide toggle), Confirm Password
- **Contact Details**: Phone Number with country code, Country & City selection
- **Identity Documents**: PAN Number, Aadhar Number

### Validation Features
- **Real-time validation** with immediate error feedback
- **Custom validation rules** for each field type
- **Password strength requirements** (minimum 8 characters)
- **Format validation** for email, PAN, Aadhar, and phone numbers
- **Dynamic city dropdown** based on country selection
- **Submit button control** - disabled until form is completely valid

### User Experience
- **Responsive design** using Tailwind CSS
- **Modern UI/UX** with clean, professional styling
- **Visual feedback** with error states and loading indicators
- **Password visibility toggle** using Lucide React icons
- **Smooth transitions** and interactive elements

### Routing & Navigation
- **Multi-page application** with React Router DOM
- **Form submission flow** from registration to success page
- **Data persistence** using localStorage
- **Protected routes** with automatic redirects

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React 19** - Latest version with modern hooks
- **React Router DOM 7** - Client-side routing
- **Tailwind CSS 4** - Utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** - Modern icon library
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react-form
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open in browser**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## 📋 Usage Instructions

1. **Fill out the registration form** - All fields marked with * are required
2. **Real-time validation** - Errors appear and disappear as you type
3. **Submit the form** - Button becomes enabled only when all validations pass
4. **View success page** - See your submitted details in a formatted layout
5. **Print or submit another** - Options available on the success page

## ✅ Validation Rules

| Field | Validation Rule |
|-------|----------------|
| First/Last Name | Required, any text |
| Username | 3-20 characters, alphanumeric + underscore only |
| Email | Valid email format (user@domain.com) |
| Password | Minimum 8 characters |
| Confirm Password | Must match password |
| Phone Number | Exactly 10 digits |
| Country | Must select from dropdown |
| City | Dynamic based on country selection |
| PAN Number | Format: ABCDE1234F (5 letters, 4 digits, 1 letter) |
| Aadhar Number | Exactly 12 digits |
